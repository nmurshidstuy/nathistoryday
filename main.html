			<p>Despite the advances in racial equality during the 1950’s and 1960’s, racism continued to dominate Southern United States.
			The plan was to use non-violent protest to send a message to those that oppressed. 
			It demonstrated civilian resistance without physical altercations.
			One of the most influential stands against racism took place throughout the first half of 1960, the Greensboro Sit-Ins.
