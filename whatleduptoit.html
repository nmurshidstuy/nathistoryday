		<p>The F.W Woolworth Company was one of the premier five-and-dime store chains in America.
		In the South, rules prohibited Africans Americans from dining at the lunch counters in the stores.
		In North Carolina, four students at North Carolina Agricultural College would attempt to change these regulation though peaceful protest.</p> 
		<p>Ezell Blair Jr. (now known as Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph Mcneil,
		were not allowed to sit at the counter of Woolworth department store because they were African American.
		In order fight back against this injustice, the “Greensboro Four”, as they became known as, used peaceful protests to send a message. 
		They also protested the murder of a 14- year old African American boy named Emmett Till, who had allegedly whistled at a white woman.
			</p>
		<p>The Greensboro Four implemented non violent protest methods inspired by historical figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress
		for Racial Equality (CORE). THey hoped to spread their intentions and spread awareness through the help of a white businessman named Ralph Johns
